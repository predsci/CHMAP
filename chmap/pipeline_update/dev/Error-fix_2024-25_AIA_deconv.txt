After Q died, and we cloned Edge to be the new Q, the AIA deconvolution 
routines were returning erroneous processed images for several months.
To fix this I am implementing the following steps:

1. Delete all AIA processed images from Nov 1, 2024 through May 1, 2025. 
   These images will retain their entries in the database, but have the
   fname_hdf column cleared.  
   chmap/pipeline_update/dev/delete_processed_images.py
2. Use the normal routine to regenerate the processed files
   chmap/pipeline_update/update_processed_images.py
3. Use the one-off routine
   chmap/pipeline_update/dev/update_lbcc_2024-25_error-fix.py
   to refresh LLBC histograms (from Nov 1, 2024) and coefficients 
   (from Aug 1, 2024).
4. Update IIT histograms from May 1, 2024 and coefficients from Feb 1, 2024
   chmap/pipeline_update/dev/update_iit_2024-25_error-fix.py
5. Re-calculate all maps from Feb 1, 2024 to present 
   chmap/pipeline_update/dev/update_maps_error-fix_2024-25.py
